\chapter{Introduction to design patterns}

\section{Safe choice in presence of polymorphism }
the visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures. It is one way to follow the open/closed principle. \footcite{Visitor pattern: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern}}

    
\subsection{Exercise 1} In this assignment you will apply the visitor design pattern to print the type of the number given as an arguments in the main program.  
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{INumber} interface: contains the method visits which return a void and take INumberVisitor as an input. 
\item \textbf{INumberVisitor} interface: contains two methods with almost identical signature namely visits which returns a void. The first method takes a MyFloat  
\item
\end{itemize}
